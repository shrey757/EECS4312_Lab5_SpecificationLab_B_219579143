# Is Resource Allocation Feasible Lab Repository

This repository contains the starter code, templates, and tests for the **Requirements Specification II** lab. Students will implement implement a function to determine the feasibility of resrouce allocation, write specifications, and explore the impact of requirements completeness on AI‑assisted coding.

## System Description
You are asked to implement a Python function that determines whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacity. The function takes as input a list of requests and available resources and returns whether a valid allocation exists. The goal is to determine feasibility of allocation based on the provided information. You may assume inputs are provided in a reasonable and consistent format. You may use ChatGPT to assist with reasoning about the problem, generating code, or writing tests. 

## Structure

- **src/solution.py** – starter file where you implement `is_allocation_feasible`. Do not rename this file.
- **test_solution.py** – Public tests you can run to check basic correctness. Use a test runner such as `pytest` to execute these tests.


## Running Tests

1. Install Python 3 if not already installed.
2. Implement your solution in `solution.py`.
3. Optionally create `student_tests.py` and write at least 5 test cases.
4. Run tests using:

```bash
pytest file_name.py
```

5. Fix any failing tests before moving on. Remember that hidden tests will check additional requirements.

## Submitting Your Work
